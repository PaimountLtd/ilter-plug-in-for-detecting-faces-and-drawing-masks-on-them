# obs-facemask-plugin

A libOBS filter plugin that detects faces and draws masks with the detected data.

## Compiling

* Clone this repository with submodules: 
```console 
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/stream-labs/facemask-plugin
```

* Download cmake:

  [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)


* Get Visual Studio 2015 (vc14) or Visual Studio 2017. When you install it, make sure you include the C++ stuff. 

  [microsoft](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/)

* Download our fork of OBS Studio:
+
  [obs-studio](https://github.com/stream-labs/obs-studio)

  Do not forget the submodules:
```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stream-labs/obs-studio.git
```
* Build obs-studio
  * Follow the build instructions here:
    
    [build instructions](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Install-Instructions#windows-build-directions)

  **Note**: You do not need to install Qt5 as a dependency, just make sure ENABLE\_UI in CMake GUI is not checked before Configure/Generate. You can also handle this by setting ENABLE\_UI to OFF in CMakeLists in the obs-studio folder.
    

* Run cmake in the facemasks folder. When you hit `CONFIGURE`, you will get errors on fields you need to fill in:


    **PATH\_OBS\_STUDIO** Path to the obs-studio folder.

    **BUILD_SLOBS** - Distributes to slobs instead of OBS Studio

    If you have the [Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) installed on your system, you might have **DLIB\_USE\_BLAS** or **DLIB\_USE\_LAPACK** turned on. Keep in mind that dlib links dynamically with these libs, so the MKL and TBB dlls will need to be found by slobs when it runs (for instance, by copying them into the slobs-client folder). I don't reccommend using these libs for this reason.

* Once you have successfully configured and generated your Visual Studio project with cmake, you can open the facemask-plugin.sln file in Visual Studio. You can now compile the plugin, which will give you a distribution folder structure that mimics the structure in slobs. For example, if you built your files in the build64 folder:

  ```console 
  build64/distribute/slobs/RelWithDebInfo/obs-plugins
  ```

   If you are going to debug facemask code make sure to build it as RelWithDebInfo configuration. You can set this in Visual Studio.

* You can copy the files in manually, or set up symbolic links so you can easily hit F5 and debug from Visual Studio. You can also modify the CMakeLists to copy the files to a desired location with each build.


## How It Works

The plugin is an OBS filter plugin. It can be broken down into 2 main parts; the plugin, and the face detection. The face detection runs in its own thread, separate from OBS.

The **plugin** portion performs the following duties:

 * Render the current frame to a texture
 * Make 3 copies of the current frame, and add them to a circular buffer to be consumed by the face detection thread.
 * Receive new face detection data from another circular buffer fed by the face detection thread. 
 * Using smoothing algorithms, the current state of faces is updated.
 * According to the user's parameters, the current faces are rendered.

The **face detection** portion runs in its own thread. It consumes frame data from the circular buffer, does the face detection computation, then feeds the resulting face data to a circular buffer that is consumed by the rendering.

The process of face detection consists of four main operations:

 * **Face Detection** The faces are detected using the histogram of oriented gradients method (HOG) in Dlib. HOG's are trained feature descriptors used for detecting objects.

 * **Tracking** Once we have detected the faces we then use a cheaper method of object tracking to follow the face. This Dlib object tracking method takes an arbitrary rectangle in an image and follows it.

 * **Facial Landmarks** Given a rectangle that locates a face, we can then use Dlib's landmark detection algorithm which uses a trained regression tree solver to find 68 2D facial landmark points, corresponding to the Multi-PIE definition (see links below).

 * **3D Pose Estimation** A subset of key points are taken from the 2D facial landmark points, and using 3D points for an arbitrary rest pose, we use openCV's solvePnP method to obtain a 3D transformation. This transform can be used to render 3D objects in the scene that track the head movement.
 
 * **Face Morphing** The 68 landmark points are used to subdivide the video quad into a mesh. Another 11 points are calculated to form the head points, and then catmull rom smoothing is performed to smooth out the contours. Then the mesh is distorted to create face morphs.

The FaceDetect object manages these operations and a current state, so that it performs the face detection, then uses object tracking to follow the face, then does landmark/3d pose estimation, and then the mesh subdivision for face morphing.

* Download and build giflossy:
  [giflossy](https://github.com/kornelski/giflossy)
 *Note: Gifview is not needed*
**Add a Path** of the gifsicle executable in the Environment Variables:
The path should look like: *%PATH_TO_YOUR_DIR%\giflossy\src*

* Install SVN:
  [SVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html)
Turn ON the **'Command Line Clients Tool'** option during the installation

### Generation:
* Start/Restart Streamlabs-OBS
* Add a Media Resource
    * Ensure that **Loop** option is *ON* and **Hide source when playback ends** is *OFF*
    * Choose video by changing *properties->local file*

* Add a filter: Face Mask Plugin
* Go to Setting of facemask-plugin:
    * Set the **Demo Mode Folder** Path (where the masks JSON files are located)
    * Turn On **Generate Thumbs**
    * Push **Done** and wait, thumbnails will be generated in the Demo Folder

*Note: if you want to regenerate existing mask, restart the program and remove associated thumbnails from the demo folder*


## Unit Testing

For Unit Testing CppUtest framework is used
* During building the facemaks project with CMAKE:
  * Set **BUILD_UNIT_TESTS** option *ON*
  * Build and Run the *facemask-plugin-test* project, it will show the report of tests
  
  
  
## Video Comparison side by side

### Setting up:
* Install FFmpeg:
  [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
  **Add a Path** of FFmpeg executable in the Environment Variables:
  The path should look like: *%PATH_TO_YOUR_DIR%\ffmpeg-%VERSION%\bin*
  
### Adding red frame at the start of the video:
Formatting video makes start/end of the looped video detectable by adding a red frame at the start
- In the *facemask-plugin/data* there is a script: **format.bat**
- Put your sample video as input.mp4 and click on the format.bat
- Or call the script from the shell 
```console 
./format.bat /path/to/the/input/video /path/to/the/output/video 
```
Example:
```console 
./format.bat inputfolder/myinput.mp4 outputfolder/myoutput.mp4 
```
It will generate output with red frame appended


### Record Video:
* Start/Restart Streamlabs-OBS
* Add a Media Resource
    * Ensure that **Loop** option is *ON* and **Hide source when playback ends** is *OFF*
    * Choose video by changing *properties->local file*
##### There are 2 ways to record video:
- ##### Automatically detecting start and end using red frame
  This is the best way to use this feature. It will align the two videos perfectly.
  * Add a filter: Face Mask Plugin
  * Go to Setting of facemask-plugin:
    * Set the **Demo Mode Folder** Path (where the output video should be generated)
  * Tick On **Demo Record**
    * If it is not working, untick and tick **Demo Record** again. It will only record the video the first time it is ticked.
  * Recording and Rendering will take some time. The video needs to loop through until red frames are detected twice. Note
  that **the video in the slobs will freeze** while the video is being extracted. You just have to wait until it is done.
- ##### Manually starting and finishing the recording
  - Start Steramlabs-OBS recorder *(don't forget to change output format (in settings/output) to mp4)*
  - Start and End recording as you see **red frame** appears

	
### Generate Side By Side Video:

* Go to Setting of facemask-plugin:
    * Choose the before video
	* Configure the before text for the video
	* Choose the after video
	* Configure the after text for the video
    * Push the Generate button
- Or call the script from the shell 
```console
